// Transport flags, parsed the same way in every game-state server in this
// family (x4mcp, fs25mcp). Keep this file identical across them.
//
// It exists because the two tools drifted into different CLIs for the
// same three ideas, and the difference only shows up as a game launching
// with no server attached:
//
//	x4mcp  play --connect ws://…  -- %command%     flags AFTER the subcommand
//	fs25mcp -relay ws://…    play -- %command%     flags BEFORE it, or ignored
//
// Go's top-level flag package stops at the first non-flag argument, so
// the second tool silently treated `-relay …` as a game argument when it
// was written the first way. Nothing errors; the game just starts blind.
//
// The convention:
//
//	--stdio            serve over stdin/stdout (the default)
//	--http host:port   listen for Streamable HTTP at /mcp
//	--relay ws://…     dial OUT to a relay and serve through it
//
// with --connect and --addr accepted as aliases for --relay and --http,
// because both are already pasted into Steam launch options and a
// launcher that suddenly rejects its own documented flag is worse than a
// slightly wider surface. One and two dashes both work, as does
// --flag=value, because every one of those has been typed here.
